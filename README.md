# CVEFetcher
A PowerShell script with a simple Windows GUI that lets you select a CSV file of CVE IDs and automatically fetches their title, description, CVSS score, and exploit availability using the CIRCL.lu CVE API. The results are saved into an updated CSV file with real-time progress tracking.
