CVE-2024-47730,crypto: hisilicon/qm - inject error before stopping queue,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: crypto: hisilicon/qm - inject error before stopping queue The master ooo cannot be completely closed when the accelerator core reports memory error. Therefore, the driver needs to inject the qm error to close the master ooo. Currently, the qm error is injected after stopping queue, memory may be released immediately after stopping queue, causing the device to access the released memory. Therefore, error is injected to close master ooo before stopping queue to ensure that the device does not access the released memory.",N/A,No,None,https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/85e81103033324d7a271dafb584991da39554a89;https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/801d64177faaec184cee1e1aa4d8487df1364a54;https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/98d3be34c9153eceadb56de50d9f9347e88d86e4;https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aa3e0db35a60002fb34ef0e4ad203aa59fd00203;https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f8024f12752e32ffbbf59e1c09d949f977ff743f;https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c5f5b813e546f7fe133539c3d7a5086cc8dd2aa1;https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b04f06fc0243600665b3b50253869533b7938468
CVE-2023-5379,Undertow: ajp request closes connection exceeding maxrequestsize,"A flaw was found in Undertow. When an AJP request is sent that exceeds the max-header-size attribute in ajp-listener, JBoss EAP is marked in an error state by mod_cluster in httpd, causing JBoss EAP to close the TCP connection without returning an AJP response. This happens because mod_proxy_cluster marks the JBoss EAP instance as an error worker when the TCP connection is closed from the backend after sending the AJP request without receiving an AJP response, and stops forwarding. This issue could allow a malicious user could to repeatedly send requests that exceed the max-header-size, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).",7.5,No,CWE-770,https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:4509;https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9582;https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9583;https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-5379;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2242099
